## Build html's

The `Rmarkdown` files  are compiles with
the R packages `rmarkdown`. Additionally `pandoc` may need to be
installed manually.

Run the R script `src/build_html.R` to update the documents in
`docs/`. Then commit all changes (*including the `html` files!*) and
push it to GitHub. The new html will be deployed automatically in a
few minutes.

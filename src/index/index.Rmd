# General information

All participants have different backgrounds and interests. For this
reason we tend to provide more exercises than you can solve in this
week. Exercises that cover fundamental concepts are marked with ★. We
recommend that everyone has a look at them. Exercises that are more
advanced are marked with ♛.



# Software {.tabset}

For most exercises we provide hints and solutions for **R**,
**Julia**, and (still a bit less polished) for **Python**.
You can attempt the exercises in any other language you are
comfortable with, however, in some cases you may find it difficult to
find corresponding packages.

**R** is a popular free software environment for statistical
computing, with an wide range of packages for a extensive array
of statistical procedures, plotting options, data handling, and
more. See this
[overview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). However, as an
interpreted language, R's performance may be slow, and deploying it in
a production environment can pose certain limitations.

**Julia** is a more recent, well designed language developed at MIT
aiming at scientific computation. It utilizes a highly efficient
just-in-time compilation for execution speeds comparable to those of C
or Fortran.  This makes Julia a great option for computationally
intensive tasks like Bayesian inference. Being a newer language than
R, you may find more rough edges in some libraries and less online
resources. The core language, however, is stable and very well
documented. Note, for the exercises in this course you will not
benefit a lot from the faster speed as all our example models are
tiny. Julia may even appear slower than R in interactive use due to
the compilation step. However, the faster execution speed of Julia
makes this a worthwhile trade-off for larger problems. Another
distinct advantage of Julia is the availability of [Automatic
Differentiation](https://juliadiff.org/) that can help a lot with
optimization and posterior sampling.

**Python** is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various applications. Libraries for data handling are comparable ot R (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) and deep learning learning frameworks such as Pytorch, Jax, Tensorflow are usually  best integrated with python. As an interpreted language, Python, like R, belongs to the slower languages (although Cython and Numba can often optimize performance-critical parts of the code).


## R
### Installation

1. Install R from the  official [webpage](https://www.r-project.org/).

2. If you do not have a favorite text editor, we recommend to install [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), the most
    widely used IDE for R.

### Install the packages used for the course

Run this code once to install all required packages for this
course. Check careful for any error messages!
```r
## all packages that we need to install
pkgs <- c("mcmcensemble", "IDPmisc", "FME", "rootSolve", "EasyABC",
          "adaptMCMC", "mvtnorm", "sensitivity", "deSolve")

## install packages if needed
for(pkg in pkgs){
    if(!(pkg %in% row.names(installed.packages()))){
        print(paste("-- Install: ", pkg))
        install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    }
}
```


### R Resources

- [A (very) short introduction to R](assets/A (very) short introduction to R.pdf){target="_blank"}


## Julia

### Installation

1. Download and install the latest stable Julia version from the  [
  official webpage](https://julialang.org/). Read the platform
  specific instructions carefully.

2. If you do not have a favorite text editor, install
     [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the Visual Studio Code [Julia
     Plugin](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) following this [instructions](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/#Installation-and-Configuration).

3. Optional: install packages for a better user experience. Packages
   are installed by typing  `] add packagename` in the Julia interpreter.
   - [Revise.jl](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/). Applies
     changes automatically when you save a file.
   - [AbbreviatedStackTraces.jl](https://github.com/BioTurboNick/AbbreviatedStackTraces.jl). Shortens the sometimes very long error messages.
   - [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl). Measure
     the execution speed, very helpful if your care about fast code.

### Install packages used for the course

Julia has a build-in package manager that also handles environments
(for Python users, think `pip` and `virtualenv` combined), see the documentation [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/). The required packages used in the exercises
are defined in the files:

- [`Project.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/src/Project.toml){target="_blank"}
  (defines the needed packages)
- [`Manifest.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/src/Manifest.toml){target="_blank"} (defines all indirect dependencies and exact versions)

Save them at a convenient location and run
the following code to install and precompile all packages. Note, the
precompilation may take several minutes!
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.activate("path to *directory* containing Manifest.toml and Project.toml")
Pkg.instantiate()
Pkg.status()
```

Later activate the environment at the beginning of every script
(before `using` the packages) with:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.activate("path to *directory* containing Manifest.toml and Project.toml")

using ...
```

### Julia resources

- Official [Julia webpage](https://julialang.org/) with downloads and
  links to many other resources.

- Official [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), rather
  technical.

- A [brief Julia introduction](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/) for
programmers.

- [Julia forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/), here you find
    most questions answered.

- [Noteworthy Differences from other
  Languages](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/)
  such as Matlab, Python, R.

- [Juliahub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Home), search for packages and
  documentation

- [JuliaNotes](https://m3g.github.io/JuliaNotes.jl/stable/), tips on workflows and other topics

- [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.github.io/), a collection of best practices for Julia development

- [Introduction to computational
  thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) A very cool MIT
  lecture using Julia and interactive notebooks.

## Python

### Installation

Python can be installed in many ways. For this exercises we used a `miniconda` installation.

1. Install `miniconda` following the instructions given [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

2. If you do not have a favorite text editor, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

### Install the packages used for the course

The packages required are defined in [`environment.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/src/environment.yml). The file defines the [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) `SummerSchoolExercises`. 
Download it to your working directory and create the `SummerSchoolExercises` environment with:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, before you run your code make sure you activate the environment:
```
conda activate SummerSchoolExercises
```


# Example models and data

### Data

Download this [zip file](
https://github.com/scheidan/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/blob/main/data/exercise_data.zip?raw=true) and extract it to convenient location. It
contains all `csv` files needed for the exercises.

### Models {.tabset}

The example models are defined in this file. Save it in a convenient
location.

#### R
- [`models.r`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/models/models.r){target="_blank"}

You can load it with `source("path_to/models.r")` in your scripts.

#### Julia
- [`models.jl`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/models/models.jl){target="_blank"}

You can load it with `include("path_to/models.jl")` in your scripts.

#### Python
- [`models.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eawag-SIAM/SiamSummerSchoolExercises/main/models/models.py){target="_blank"}

The easiest way to load the models into your scripts is by storing the models.py file in the same location as the scripts.
If models.py are not stored in the same directory as the scripts, one should change the working directory to the given location
before importing the functions.

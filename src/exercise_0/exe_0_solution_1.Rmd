### Solution

- The joint probability $P_{A,B}(1,2) = 0.1$ can be read directly from the table.
- The marginal $P_{B}(2)$ is computed by summing over all      joint probabilities with $B=2$, i.e. $P_{A,B}(1,2) + P_{A,B}(2,2) = 0.2$.
- Using the results from above we can compute the conditional probability $P_{A|B}(1|2)=\frac{P_{A,B}(1,2)}{P_{B}(2)}=0.5$.
- $A$ and $B$ are not independent. To see this calculate first the
  marginal probabilities. In this example the joint probability is not
  equal to the product of the marginal probabilities,
  $P_{A,B}(a,b) \neq P_{A}(a) \,P_{B}(b)$, hence $A$ and $B$
  cannot be independent.

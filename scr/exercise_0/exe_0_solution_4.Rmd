### Solution {.tabset}

#### R
1. evaluate pdf
```{r}
dunif(0.8, 0, 1)
dnorm(0.8, 2, 10)

```
2. sample from distributions and plot them
```{r}
xs <- runif(10000, 0, 1)
ys <- rnorm(10000, 2, 10)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))                       # optional, arranges both plots together
hist(xs)
hist(ys)

```

3. sample from $Z$
```{r}
xs <- runif(10000, 0, 1)                # sample from X
zs <- sin(2*pi*xs) * sqrt(xs)           # transfrom samples

```

```{r}
hist(zs, breaks=75)
```
